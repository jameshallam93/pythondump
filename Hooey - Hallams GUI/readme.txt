This was my first (and still unfinished) attempt at creating a fully fledged user interface, intended to contain a range of projects to use as a portfolio piece. The GUI is operational, but it appears that the only finished piece (Tic Tac Toe game) was saved on a buggy version - should be able to fix it without too much difficulty, but the whole project needs a major amount of work.
